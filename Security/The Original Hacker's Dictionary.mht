<H1>The Original Hacker's Dictionary</H1>
<P>[This file, jargon.txt, was maintained on MIT-AI for many years, =
before being=20
published by Guy Steele and others as the Hacker's Dictionary. Many =
years after=20
the original book went out of print, Eric Raymond picked it up, updated =
it and=20
republished it as the New Hacker's Dictionary. Unfortunately, in the =
process, he=20
essentially destroyed what held it together, in various ways: first, by =
changing=20
its emphasis from Lisp-based to UNIX-based (blithely ignoring the =
distinctly=20
anti-UNIX aspects of the LISP culture celebrated in the original); =
second, by=20
watering down what was otherwise the fairly undiluted record of a single =

cultural group through this kind of mixing; and third, by adding in all =
sorts of=20
terms which are "jargon" only in the sense that they're technical. This =
page,=20
however, is pretty much the original, snarfed from MIT-AI around 1988. =
-- jpd.]=20
<P><B>Verb doubling</B>: a standard construction is to double a verb and =
use i=20
as a comment on what the implied subject does. Often used to terminate a =

conversation. Typical examples involve WIN, LOSE, HACK, FLAME, BARF, =
CHOMP.=20
<I>"The disk heads just crashed." "Lose, lose." "Mostly he just talked =
about his=20
--- crock. Flame, flame." "Boy, what a bagbiter! Chomp, chomp!"</I>=20
<P><B>Soundalike slang</B>: similar to Cockney rhyming slang. Often made =
up on=20
the spur of the moment. Standard examples: <I>Boston Globe =3D&gt; =
Boston Glob;=20
Herald American =3D&gt; Horrid (Harried) American; New York Times =
=3D&gt; New York=20
Slime; historical reasons =3D&gt; hysterical raisins; government =
property - do not=20
duplicate (seen on keys) =3D&gt; government duplicity - do not =
propagate.=20
</I>Often the substitution will be made in such a way as to slip in a =
standard=20
jargon word: <I>Dr. Dobb's Journal =3D&gt; Dr. Frob's Journal; creeping =
featurism=20
=3D&gt; feeping creaturism; Margaret Jacks Hall =3D&gt; Marginal Hacks =
Hall. </I>
<P><B>The -P convention</B>: turning a word into a question by appending =
the=20
syllable "P"; from the LISP convention of appending the letter "P" to =
denote a=20
predicate (a Boolean-values function). The question should expect a =
yes/no=20
answer, though it needn't. (See T and NIL.) <I>At dinnertime: "Foodp?" =
"Yeah,=20
I'm pretty hungry." or "T!"; "State-of-the-world-P?" (Straight) "I'm =
about to go=20
home." (Humorous) "Yes, the world has a state." </I>
<P>[One of the best of these is a Gosperism (i.e., due to Bill Gosper). =
When we=20
were at a Chinese restaurant, he wanted to know whether someone would =
like to=20
share with him a two-person-sized bowl of soup. His inquiry was: =
"Split-p soup?"=20
--GLS]=20
<P><B>Peculiar nouns</B>: MIT AI hackers love to take various words and =
add the=20
wrong endings to them to make nouns and verbs, often by extending a =
standard=20
rule to nonuniform cases. Examples: <I>porous =3D&gt; porosity. generous =
=3D&gt;=20
generosity. Ergo: mysterious =3D&gt; mysteriosity. ferrous =3D&gt; =
ferocity.=20
</I>Other examples: winnitude, disgustitude, hackification.=20
<P><B>Spoken inarticulations</B>: Words such as "mumble", "sigh", and =
"groan"=20
are spoken in places where their referent might more naturally be used. =
It has=20
been suggested that this usage derives from the impossibility of =
representing=20
such noises in a com link. Another expression sometimes heard is =
"complain!"=20
<P><B>@BEGIN</B> (primarily CMU) with @END, used humorously in writing =
to=20
indicate a context or to remark on the surrounded text. From the SCRIBE =
command=20
of the same name. For example: <PRE>	@Begin(Flame)
	Predicate logic is the only good programming language.
	Anyone who would use anything else is an idiot.  Also,
	computers should be tredecimal instead of binary.
	@End(Flame)
</PRE>
<P><B>ANGLE BRACKETS</B> (primarily MIT) n. Either of the characters =

to have become a new word.=20
<P><B>AUTOMAGICALLY</B> adv. Automatically, but in a way which, for some =
reason=20
(typically because it is too complicated, or too ugly, or perhaps even =
too=20
trivial), I don't feel like explaining to you. See MAGIC. Example: Some =
programs=20
which produce XGP output files spool them automagically.=20
<P><B>BAGBITER</B> 1. n. Equipment or program that fails, usually=20
intermittently. 2. BAGBITING: adj. Failing hardware or software. "This =
bagbiting=20
system won't let me get out of spacewar." Usage: verges on obscenity.=20

LOSER,=20
LOSING, CRETINOUS, BLETCHEROUS, BARFUCIOUS, CHOMPER, CHOMPING.=20

produce=20
FOOBAR.=20
<P><B>BARF</B> [from the "layman" slang, meaning "vomit"] 1. interj. =
Term of=20
disgust. See BLETCH. 2. v. Choke, as on input. May mean to give an error =

message. "The function `=3D' compares two fixnums or two flonums, and =
barfs on=20
anything else." 3. BARFULOUS, BARFUCIOUS: adj. Said of something which =
would=20
make anyone barf, if only for aesthetic reasons.=20
<P><B>BELLS AND WHISTLES</B> n. Unnecessary but useful (or amusing) =
features of=20
a program. "Now that we've got the basic program working, let's go back =

from a=20
whistle.=20
<P><B>BIGNUMS</B> [from Macsyma] n. 1. In backgammon, large numbers on =
the dice.=20
2. Multiple-precision (sometimes infinitely extendable) integers and, =
through=20
analogy, any very large numbers. 3. EL CAMINO BIGNUM: El Camino Real, a =
street=20
through the San Francisco peninsula that originally extended (and still =
appears=20
in places) all the way to Mexico City. It was termed "El Camino Double=20

Camino=20
Bignum" when it was pointed out that it was hundreds of miles long.=20
<P><B>BIN</B> [short for BINARY; used as a second file name on ITS] 1. =
n.=20
BINARY. 2. BIN FILE: A file containing the BIN for a program. Usage: =
used at=20
MIT, which runs on ITS. The equivalent term at Stanford is DMP =
(pronounced=20
"dump") FILE. Other names used include SAV ("save") FILE (DEC and =
Tenex), SHR=20
("share") and LOW FILES (DEC), and EXE ("ex'ee") FILE (DEC and Twenex). =
Also in=20
this category are the input files to the various flavors of linking =
loaders=20
(LOADER, LINK-10, STINK), called REL FILES.=20
<P><B>BINARY</B> n. The object code for a program.=20
<P><B>BIT</B> n. 1. The unit of information; the amount of information =
obtained=20
by asking a yes-or-no question. "Bits" is often used simply to mean =
information,=20
as in "Give me bits about DPL replicators". 2. [By extension from =
"interrupt=20
bits" on a computer] A reminder that something should be done or talked =
about=20
eventually. Upon seeing someone that you haven't talked to for a while, =
it's=20
common for one or both to say, "I have a bit set for you."=20
<P><B>BITBLT</B> (bit'blit) 1. v. To perform a complex operation on a =

<P><B>BLT</B> (blit, very rarely belt) [based on the PDP-10 block =
transfer=20
instruction; confusing to users of the PDP-11] 1. v. To transfer a large =

contiguous package of information from one place to another. 2. THE BIG =
BLT: n.=20
Shuffling operation on the PDP-10 under some operating systems that =
consumes a=20
significant amount of computer time. 3. (usually pronounced B-L-T) n. =
Sandwich=20
containing bacon, lettuce, and tomato.=20
<P><B>BOGOSITY</B> n. The degree to which something is BOGUS (q.v.). At =
CMU,=20
bogosity is measured with a bogometer; typical use: in a seminar, when a =
speaker=20
says something bogus, a listener might raise his hand and say, "My =
bogometer=20
just triggered." The agreed-upon unit of bogosity is the microLenat =
(uL).=20
<P><B>BOGUS</B> (WPI, Yale, Stanford) adj. 1. Non-functional. "Your =
patches are=20
bogus." 2. Useless. "OPCON is a bogus program." 3. False. "Your =
arguments are=20
bogus." 4. Incorrect. "That algorithm is bogus." 5. Silly. "Stop writing =
those=20
bogus sagas." (This word seems to have some, but not all, of the =
connotations of=20
RANDOM.) [Etymological note from Lehman/Reid at CMU: "Bogus" was =
originally used=20
(in this sense) at Princeton, in the late 60's. It was used not =
particularly in=20
the CS department, but all over campus. It came to Yale, where one of us =

(Lehman) was an undergraduate, and (we assume) elsewhere through the =
efforts of=20
Princeton alumni who brought the word with them from their alma mater. =
In the=20
Yale case, the alumnus is Michael Shamos, who was a graduate student at =
Yale and=20
is now a faculty member here. A glossary of bogus words was compiled at =
Yale=20
when the word was first popularized (e.g., autobogophobia: the fear of =
becoming=20
bogotified).]=20
<P><B>BOUNCE</B> (Stanford) v. To play volleyball. "Bounce, bounce! Stop =
wasting=20
time on the computer and get out to the court!"=20
<P><B>BRAIN-DAMAGED</B> [generalization of "Honeywell Brain Damage" =
(HBD), a=20
theoretical disease invented to explain certain utter cretinisms in =
Multics]=20
adj. Obviously wrong; cretinous; demented. There is an implication that =
the=20
person responsible must have suffered brain damage, because he should =
have known=20
better. Calling something brain-damaged is really bad; it also implies =
it is=20
unusable.=20
<P><B>BREAK</B> v. 1. To cause to be broken (in any sense). "Your latest =
patch=20
to the system broke the TELNET server." 2. (of a program) To stop =
temporarily,=20
so that it may be examined for debugging purposes. The place where it =
stops is a=20
BREAKPOINT.=20
<P><B>BROKEN</B> adj. 1. Not working properly (of programs). 2. Behaving =

strangely; especially (of people), exhibiting extreme depression.=20
<P><B>BROKET</B> [by analogy with "bracket": a "broken bracket"] =
(primarily=20
Stanford) n. Either of the characters "&lt;" and "&gt;". (At MIT, and =
apparently=20
in The Real World (q.v.) as well, these are usually called ANGLE =
BRACKETS.)=20
<P><B>BUCKY BITS</B> (primarily Stanford) n. The bits produced by the =
CTRL and=20
META shift keys on a Stanford (or Knight) keyboard. Rumor has it that =
the idea=20
for extra bits for characters came from Niklaus Wirth, and that his =
nickname was=20
`Bucky'. DOUBLE BUCKY: adj. Using both the CTRL and META keys. "The =
command to=20
burn all LEDs is double bucky F."=20
<P><B>BUG</B> [from telephone terminology, "bugs in a telephone cable", =
blamed=20
for noisy lines; however, Jean Sammet has repeatedly been heard to claim =
that=20
the use of the term in CS comes from a story concerning actual bugs =
found wedged=20
in an early malfunctioning computer] n. An unwanted and unintended =
property of a=20
program. (People can have bugs too (even winners) as in "PHW is a super =
winner,=20
but he has some bugs.") See FEATURE.=20
<P><B>BUM</B> 1. v. To make highly efficient, either in time or space, =
often at=20
the expense of clarity. The object of the verb is usually what was =
removed ("I=20
managed to bum three more instructions.") but can be the program being =
changed=20
("I bummed the inner loop down to seven microseconds.") 2. n. A small =
change to=20
an algorithm to make it more efficient.=20
<P><B>BUZZ</B> v. To run in a very tight loop, perhaps without guarantee =
of=20
getting out.=20
<P><B>CANONICAL</B> adj. The usual or standard state or manner of =
something. A=20
true story: One Bob Sjoberg, new at the MIT AI Lab, expressed some =
annoyance at=20
the use of jargon. Over his loud objections, we made a point of using =
jargon as=20
much as possible in his presence, and eventually it began to sink in. =
Finally,=20
in one conversation, he used the word "canonical" in jargon-like fashion =
without=20
thinking. <I>Steele: "Aha! We've finally got you talking jargon too!" =
Stallman:=20
"What did he say?" Steele: "He just used `canonical' in the canonical =
way." </I>
<P><B>CATATONIA</B> (kat-uh-toe'nee-uh) n. A condition of suspended =
animation in=20
which the system is in a wedged (CATATONIC) state.=20
<P><B>CDR</B> (ku'der) [from LISP] v. With "down", to trace down a list =
of=20
elements. "Shall we cdr down the agenda?" Usage: silly.=20
<P><B>CHINE NUAL</B> n. The Lisp Machine Manual, so called because the =
title is=20
wrapped around the cover so only those letters show.=20
<P><B>CHOMP</B> v. To lose; to chew on something of which more was =
bitten off=20
than one can. Probably related to gnashing of teeth. See BAGBITER. A =
hand=20
gesture commonly accompanies this, consisting of the four fingers held =
together=20
as if in a mitten or hand puppet, and the fingers and thumb open and =
close=20
rapidly to illustrate a biting action. The gesture alone means CHOMP =
CHOMP (see=20
Verb Doubling).=20
<P><B>CLOSE</B> n. Abbreviation for "close (or right) parenthesis", used =
when=20
necessary to eliminate oral ambiguity. See OPEN.=20
<P><B>COKEBOTTLE</B> n. Any very unusual character. MIT people complain =
about=20
the "control-meta-cokebottle" commands at SAIL, and SAIL people complain =
about=20
the "altmode-altmode-cokebottle" commands at MIT.=20
<P><B>COM MODE</B> (variant: COMM MODE) [from the ITS feature for =
linking two or=20
more terminals together so that text typed on any is echoed on all, =
providing a=20
means of conversation among hackers] n. The state a terminal is in when =
linked=20
to another in this way. Com mode has a special set of jargon words, used =
to save=20
typing, which are not used orally: <PRE>BCNU	Be seeing you.
BTW	By the way...
BYE?	Are you ready to unlink?  (This is the standard way to end a com =
mode conversation; the other person types BYE to confirm, or else =
continues the conversation.)
CUL	See you later.
FOO?	A greeting, also meaning R U THERE?  Often used in the case of =
unexpected links, meaning also "Sorry if I butted in" (linker) or =
"What's up?" (linkee).
FYI	For your information...
GA	Go ahead (used when two people have tried to type simultaneously; =
this cedes the right to type to the other).
HELLOP	A greeting, also meaning R U THERE?  (An instance of the "-P" =
convention.)
MtFBWY	May the Force be with you.  (From Star Wars.)
NIL	No (see the main entry for NIL).
OBTW	Oh, by the way...
R U THERE?	Are you there?
SEC	Wait a second (sometimes written SEC...).
T	Yes (see the main entry for T).
TNX	Thanks.
TNX 1.0E6	Thanks a million (humorous).
</PRE>&lt;double CRLF&gt; When the typing party has finished, he types =
two=20
CRLF's to signal that he is done; this leaves a blank line between =
individual=20
"speeches" in the conversation, making it easier to re-read the =
preceding text.=20
<P>&lt;name&gt;: When three or more terminals are linked, each speech is =

preceded by the typist's login name and a colon (or a hyphen) to =
indicate who is=20
typing. The login name often is shortened to a unique prefix (possibly a =
single=20
letter) during a very long conversation.=20
<P>/\/\/\ The equivalent of a giggle.=20
<P>At Stanford, where the link feature is implemented by "talk loops", =
the term=20
TALK MODE is used in place of COM MODE. Most of the above "sub-jargon" =
is used=20
at both Stanford and MIT.=20
<P><B>CONNECTOR CONSPIRACY</B> [probably came into prominence with the=20
appearance of the KL-10, none of whose connectors match anything else] =
n. The=20
tendency of manufacturers (or, by extension, programmers or purveyors of =

anything) to come up with new products which don't fit together with the =
old=20
stuff, thereby making you buy either all new stuff or expensive =
interface=20
devices.=20
<P><B>CONS</B> [from LISP] 1. v. To add a new element to a list. 2. CONS =
UP: v.=20
To synthesize from smaller pieces: "to cons up an example".=20
<P><B>CRASH</B> 1. n. A sudden, usually drastic failure. Most often said =
of the=20
system (q.v., definition #1), sometimes of magnetic disk drives. "Three =
lusers=20
lost their files in last night's disk crash." A disk crash which entails =
the=20
read/write heads dropping onto the surface of the disks and scraping off =
the=20
oxide may also be referred to as a "head crash". 2. v. To fail suddenly. =
"Has=20
the system just crashed?" Also used transitively to indicate the cause =
of the=20
crash (usually a person or a program, or both). "Those idiots playing =
spacewar=20
crashed the system." Sometimes said of people. See GRONK OUT.=20
<P><B>CRETIN</B> 1. n. Congenital loser (q.v.). 2. CRETINOUS: adj. See=20
BLETCHEROUS and BAGBITING. Usage: somewhat ad hominem.=20
<P><B>CRLF</B> (cur'lif, sometimes crul'lif) n. A carriage return (CR) =
followed=20
by a line feed (LF). See TERPRI.=20
<P><B>CROCK</B> [probably from "layman" slang, which in turn may be =
derived from=20
"crock of shit"] n. An awkward feature or programming technique that =
ought to be=20
made cleaner. Example: Using small integers to represent error codes =
without the=20
program interpreting them to the user is a crock. Also, a technique that =
works=20
acceptably but which is quite prone to failure if disturbed in the =
least, for=20
example depending on the machine opcodes having particular bit patterns =
so that=20
you can use instructions as data words too; a tightly woven, almost =
completely=20
unmodifiable structure.=20
<P><B>CRUFTY</B> [from "cruddy"] adj. 1. Poorly built, possibly overly =
complex.=20
"This is standard old crufty DEC software". Hence CRUFT, n. shoddy =
construction.=20
Also CRUFT, v. [from hand cruft, pun on hand craft] to write assembler =
code for=20
something normally (and better) done by a compiler. 2. Unpleasant, =
especially to=20
the touch, often with encrusted junk. Like spilled coffee smeared with =
peanut=20
butter and catsup. Hence CRUFT, n. disgusting mess. 3. Generally =
unpleasant.=20
CRUFTY or CRUFTIE n. A small crufty object (see FROB); often one which =
doesn't=20
fit well into the scheme of things. "A LISP property list is a good =
place to=20
store crufties (or, random cruft)." [Note: Does CRUFT have anything to =
do with=20
the Cruft Lab at Harvard? I don't know, though I was a Harvard student. =
- GLS]=20
<P><B>CRUNCH</B> v. 1. To process, usually in a time-consuming or =
complicated=20
way. Connotes an essentially trivial operation which is nonetheless =
painful to=20
perform. The pain may be due to the triviality being imbedded in a loop =
from 1=20
to 1000000000. "FORTRAN programs do mostly number crunching." 2. To =
reduce the=20
size of a file by a complicated scheme that produces bit configurations=20
completely unrelated to the original data, such as by a Huffman code. =
(The file=20
ends up looking like a paper document would if somebody crunched the =
paper into=20
a wad.) Since such compression usually takes more computations than =
simpler=20
methods such as counting repeated characters (such as spaces) the term =
is doubly=20
appropriate. (This meaning is usually used in the construction "file=20
crunch(ing)" to distinguish it from "number crunch(ing)".) 3. n. The =
character=20
"#". Usage: used at Xerox and CMU, among other places. Other names for =
"#"=20
include SHARP, NUMBER, HASH, PIG-PEN, POUND-SIGN, and MESH. GLS adds: I =
recall=20
reading somewhere that most of these are names for the # symbol IN =
CONTEXT. The=20
name for the sign itself is "octothorp".=20
<P><B>CTY</B> (city) n. The terminal physically associated with a =
computer's=20
operating console.=20
<P><B>CUSPY</B> [from the DEC acronym CUSP, for Commonly Used System =
Program,=20
i.e., a utility program used by many people] (WPI) adj. 1. (of a =
program)=20
Well-written. 2. Functionally excellent. A program which performs well =
and=20
interfaces well to users is cuspy. See RUDE.=20
<P><B>DAEMON</B> (day'mun, dee'mun) [archaic form of "demon", which has =
slightly=20
different connotations (q.v.)] n. A program which is not invoked =
explicitly, but=20
which lays dormant waiting for some condition(s) to occur. The idea is =
that the=20
perpetrator of the condition need not be aware that a daemon is lurking =
(though=20
often a program will commit an action only because it knows that it will =

implicitly invoke a daemon). For example, writing a file on the lpt =
spooler's=20
directory will invoke the spooling daemon, which prints the file. The =
advantage=20
is that programs which want (in this example) files printed need not =
compete for=20
access to the lpt. They simply enter their implicit requests and let the =
daemon=20
decide what to do with them. Daemons are usually spawned automatically =
by the=20
system, and may either live forever or be regenerated at intervals. =
Usage:=20
DAEMON and DEMON (q.v.) are often used interchangeably, but seem to have =

distinct connotations. DAEMON was introduced to computing by CTSS people =
(who=20
pronounced it dee'mon) and used it to refer to what is now called a =
DRAGON or=20
PHANTOM (q.v.). The meaning and pronunciation have drifted, and we think =
this=20
glossary reflects current usage.=20
<P><B>DAY MODE</B> See PHASE (of people).=20
<P><B>DEADLOCK</B> n. A situation wherein two or more processes are =
unable to=20
proceed because each is waiting for another to do something. A common =
example is=20
a program communicating to a PTY or STY, which may find itself waiting =
for=20
output from the PTY/STY before sending anything more to it, while the =
PTY/STY is=20
similarly waiting for more input from the controlling program before =
outputting=20
anything. (This particular flavor of deadlock is called "starvation". =
Another=20
common flavor is "constipation", where each process is trying to send =
stuff to=20
the other, but all buffers are full because nobody is reading anything.) =
See=20
DEADLY EMBRACE.=20
<P><B>DEADLY EMBRACE</B> n. Same as DEADLOCK (q.v.), though usually used =
only=20
when exactly two processes are involved. DEADLY EMBRACE is the more =
popular term=20
in Europe; DEADLOCK in the United States.=20
<P><B>DEMENTED</B> adj. Yet another term of disgust used to describe a =
program.=20
The connotation in this case is that the program works as designed, but =
the=20
design is bad. For example, a program that generates large numbers of=20

only for wallpaper, as evidenced at SAIL where it was used as such to =
cover=20
windows.) Usage: not often used now, esp. since other systems have =
developed=20
other terms for it (e.g., PHOTO on TWENEX). The term possibly originated =
on ITS,=20
