<BR></FONT></A></H3>
<P>This book teaches you all about the Java language and how to use it to create applets and applications. By the time you get through with this book, you'll know enough about Java to do just about anything, inside an applet or out.

<foNT SIZE=4><B>Who Should Read This Book</B>
<BR></FONT></A></H3>
<P>This book is intended for people with at least some basic programming background, which includes people with years of programming experience or people with only a small amount of experience. If you understand what variables, loops, and functions are, you'll be just fine for this book. The sorts
of people who might want to read this book include you, if
<BR></P>
<UL>
<LI>You're a real whiz at HTML, understand CGI programming (in Perl, AppleScript, Visual Basic, or some other popular CGI language) pretty well, and want to move on to the next level in Web page design.
<BR>
<BR></LI>
<LI>You had some Basic or Pascal in school and you have a basic grasp of what programming is, but you've heard Java is easy to learn, really powerful, and very cool.
<BR>
<BR></LI>
<LI>You've programmed C and C++ for many years, you've heard this Java thing is becoming really popular and you're wondering what all the fuss is all about.
<BR>
<BR></LI>
<LI>You've heard that Java is really good for Web-based applets, and you're curious about how good it is for creating more general applications.
<BR>
<BR></LI></UL>
<P>What if you know programming, but you don't know object-oriented programming? Fear not. This book assumes no background in object-oriented design. If you know object-oriented programming, in fact, the first couple of days will be easy for you.

<foNT SIZE=4><B>Introduction</B>
<BR></FONT></A></H3>
<P>The World Wide Web, for much of its existence, has been a method for distributing passive information to a widely distributed number of people. The Web has, indeed, been exceptionally good for that purpose. With the addition of forms and image maps, Web pages began to become interactive&#151;but
 the interaction was often simply a new way to get at the same information. The limitations of Web distribution were all too apparent once designers began to try to stretch the boundaries of what the Web can do. Even other innovations, such as Netscape's server push to create dynamic animations, we
re merely clever tricks layered on top of a framework that wasn't built to support much other than static documents with images and text.
<BR></P>
<P>Enter Java, and the capability for Web pages to contain Java applets. Applets are small programs that create animations, multimedia presentations, real-time (video) games, multi-user networked games, and real interactivity&#151;in fact, most anything a small program can do, Java applets can. Dow
nloaded over the net and executed inside a Web page by a browser that supports Java, applets are an enormous step beyond standard Web design.
<BR></P>
<P>The disadvantage of Java is that to create Java applets right now, you need to write them in the Java language. Java is a programming language, and as such, creating Java applets is more difficult than creating a Web page or a form using HTML. Soon there will be tools and programs that will make
 creating Java applets easier&#151;they may be available by the time you read this. For now, however, the only way to delve into Java is to learn the language and start playing with the raw Java code. Even when the tools come out, you may want to do more with Java than the tools can provide, and yo
u're back to learning the language.
<BR></P>
<P>That's where <I>Teach Yourself Java in 21 Days</I> comes in. This book teaches you all about the Java language and how to use it to create not only applets, but also applications, which are more general Java programs that don't need to run inside a Web browser. By the time you get through with t
his book, you'll know enough about Java to do just about anything, inside an applet or out.

<foNT SIZE=3><B>Who Should Read This Book</B>
<BR></FONT></A></H4>
<P><I>Teach Yourself Java in 21 Days</I> is intended for people with at least some basic programming background&#151;which includes people with years of programming experience and people with only a small amount of experience. If you understand what variables, loops, and functions are, you'll be ju
st fine for this book. The sorts of people who might want to read this book include you, if one or more of the following is true:
<BR></P>

<BR></P>
<P>What if you're a rank beginner? This book might move a little fast for you. Java is a good language to start with, though, and if you take it slow and work through all the examples, you may still be able to pick up Java and start creating your own applets.
<BR></P>
<H4><A ID = "I13" NAME = "I13"  >
<foNT SIZE=3><B>How This Book Is Organized</B>
<BR></FONT></A></H4>
<P><I>Teach Yourself Java in 21 Days</I> describes Java primarily in its current state&#151;what's known as the 1.0 API (Application Programming Interface). This is the version of Java that Netscape and other browsers, such as Spyglass's Mosaic, support. A previous version of Java, the alpha API, w
as significantly different from the version described in this book, and the two versions are not compatible with each other. There are other books that describe only the alpha API, and there may still be programs and browsers out there that can only run using alpha Java programs.
<BR></P>
<P>The 1.0 API is, as of this writing, the most current version, the one supported by Java-enabled browsers like Netscape Navigator 2.0, and the one most likely to be supported in the future. The alpha API is obsolete and will eventually die out. If you learn Java using the current API, you'll be m
uch better prepared for Java's future than if you have to worry about both APIs at once.
<BR></P>
<P>Java is still in development. &quot;Beta&quot; means that Java is not complete and that things may change between the time this book is being written and the time you read this. Keep this in mind as you work with Java and with the software you'll use to create and compile programs. If things are
n't behaving the way you expect, check the Web sites mentioned at the end of this introduction for more information.
<BR></P>
<P><I>Teach Yourself Java in 21 Days</I> covers the Java language and its class libraries in 21 days, organized as three separate weeks. Each week covers a different broad area of developing Java applets and applications.
<BR></P>
<P>In the first week, you'll learn about the Java language itself:
<BR></P>
<UL>
<LI>Day 1 is the basic introduction: what Java is, why it's cool, and how to get the software. You'll also create your first Java applications and applets.
<BR>
<BR></LI>
<LI>On Day 2, you'll explore basic object-oriented programming concepts as they apply to Java.
<BR>
<BR></LI>
<LI>On Day 3, you start getting down to details with the basic Java building blocks: data types, variables, and expressions such as arithmetic and comparisons.
<BR>
<BR></LI>
<LI>Day 4 goes into detail about how to deal with objects in Java: how to create them, how to access their variables and call their methods, and how to compare and copy them. You'll also get your first glance at the Java class libraries.
<BR>
<BR></LI>
<LI>On Day 5, you'll learn more about Java with arrays, conditional statements. and loops.
<BR>
<BR></LI>
<LI>Day 6 is the best one yet. You'll learn how to create classes, the basic building blocks of any Java program, as well as how to put together a Java application (an application being a Java program that can run on its own without a Web browser).
<BR>
<BR></LI>
<LI>Day 7 builds on what you learned on Day 6. On Day 7, you'll learn more about how to create and use methods, including overriding and overloading methods and creating constructors.
<BR>
<BR></LI></UL>
<P>Week 2 is dedicated to applets and the Java class libraries:
<BR></P>
<UL>
<LI>Day 8 provides the basics of applets&#151;how they're different from applications, how to create them, and the most important parts of an applet's life cycle. You'll also learn how to create HTML pages that contain Java applets.
<BR>
<BR></LI>
<LI>On Day 9, you'll learn about the Java classes for drawing shapes and characters to the screen&#151;in black, white, or any other color.
<BR>
<BR></LI>
<LI>On Day 10, you'll start animating those shapes you learned about on Day 9, including learning what threads and their uses are.
<BR>
<BR></LI>
<LI>Day 11 covers more detail about animation, adding bitmap images and audio to the soup.
<BR>
<BR></LI>
<LI>Day 12 delves into interactivity&#151;handling mouse and keyboard clicks from the user in your Java applets.
<BR>
<BR></LI>
<LI>Day 13 is ambitious; on that day you'll learn about using Java's Abstract Windowing Toolkit to create a user interface in your applet including menus, buttons, checkboxes, and other elements.
<BR>
<BR></LI>
<LI> On Day 14, you explore the last of the main Java class libraries for creating applets: windows and dialogs, networking, and a few other tidbits.
<BR>
<BR></LI></UL>
<P>Week 3 finishes up with advanced topics, for when you start doing larger and more complex Java programs, or when you want to learn more:

<P>Before, while, and after you read this book, there are two Web sites that may be of interest to you as a Java developer.
<BR></P>
<P>The official Java web site is at <A HREF = "javascript:if(confirm('http://java.sun.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://java.sun.com/'" tppabs="http://java.sun.com/"  > http://java.sun.com/</A>. At this site, you'll find the Java development software, the HotJava web browser, and online documentation for all aspects of the Java language. It has several mirror sites that it lists online, and yo
u should probably use the site &quot;closest&quot; to you on the Internet for your downloading and Java Web browsing. There is also a site for developer resources, called Gamelan, at <A HREF = "javascript:if(confirm('http://www.gamelan.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.gamelan.com/'" tppabs="http://www.gamelan.com/"  >http://www.gamelan.com/</A>.
