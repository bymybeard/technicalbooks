<P>The diagrams in this appendix are class hierarchy diagrams for the package java and for all the subpackages recursively below it in the Java beta binary release.
<BR></P>
<P>Each page contains the class hierarchy <A ID = "I4" NAME = "I4"  ></A><A ID = "I5" NAME = "I5"  ></A><A ID = "I6" NAME = "I6"  ></A>for one package (or a subtree of a particularly large package) with all its interfaces included, and each class in this tree is shown attached to its superclasses, even if they are on another page. A detailed key is located on the first page of this Appendix.

<NOTE>
<IMG SRC="note.gif" tppabs="http://newdata.box.sk/bx/java/note.gif" WIDTH = 35 HEIGHT = 35><B>Note</B>: Win32Process and UNIXProcess appear in their respective distributions of Java, but both implement (essentially) the same protocol as their common abstract superclass&#151;Process&#151;so only it was included. This means that are no platform-dependent classes in the diagrams. (Of course, each release actually has some such classes in its .class directories.) Several abstract classes have no subclasses in the documented library, but any concrete implementation of Java would define subclasses of them.
<BR></NOTE>

<P>I supplemented the (incomplete) API documentation by looking through all the source files (below src/java) to find all the (missing) package classes and their relationships.
<BR></P>
<P>I've heard there are various programs that auto-layout hierarchies for you, but I did these the old-fashioned way (in other words, I <I>earned</I> it, as J.H. used to say). One nice side effect is that these diagrams should be more readable than a computer would produce, though you will have to live with my aesthetic choices (sorry). I chose, for example, to attach lines through the center of each class node, something which I think looks and feels better overall (to me) but which on occasion can be a little confusing. Follow lines through the center of the classes (not at the corners, nor along any line not passing through the center) to connect the dots mentally.
