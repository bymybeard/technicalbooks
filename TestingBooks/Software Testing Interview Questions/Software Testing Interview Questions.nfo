The competence and quality of software testers are often judged by the various 
testing techniques they have 
mastered. As the name suggests, the book provides a self-study format and is 
designed for certification course 
review, and for freshers as well as professionals who are searching for 
opportunities in the software testing field. 
Along with software testing basics, the book covers software testing techniques 
and interview questions (e.g., Six 
Sigma and CMMI) which are important from the Software Quality Assurance (SQA) 
perspective. It also has in-depth 
coverage of software expense estimation topics like function points (FPA) and 
TPA analysis. A CD-ROM supplements the 
content with the TestCompleteTM software-testing tool setup, software estimation 
templates (PDFs), an interview 
rating sheet, a sample resume, third-party contributions, and more.
